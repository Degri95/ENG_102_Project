            <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>It seems no industry is safe from artificial intelligence (AI). The very words can cause mass panic to the uninformed. Cybersecurity is one of the many sectors that's seen a rise in AI use. But what does this mean? What does the future of cybersecurity hold? Let's take a look at the impact AI is having on cybersecurity and what the future might hold for this critical field.</p>

            <h3>The Future</h3>
            <p>We're witnessing a real time revolution in the technology sector. Artificial intelligence  has been able to provide capabilities and solutions unlike ever before. These solutions are being implemented in the cybersecurity industry at an alarming rate. Implementing these new systems with a holistic view has become necessary to keeping a strong cybersecurity system. Implementing AI into cybersecurity isn't just a trend, it's the future of threat detection, mitigation, and protection.</p>
            <h3>The Shift</h3>
            <p>With existing cybersecurity practices involving heavy manual tasks and reviews, AI not only saves time, but money and the risk of an oversight. Tasks are automated, threats are flagged, and data is analyzed in real time. The gap of skilled professionals is being closed by an artificial system. It's become imperative to work together with these systems to maintain a secure environment. It's not "If" these systems are used but "when". Our cyber professionals' skill set will need to expand into the field of AI to maintain a strong defense.</p>
